                                Sound, in particular, was significant to me during the pandemic. There were some sounds which irritated me. And others, common in our everyday life, that I had not noticed so profoundly before. My work, therefore, uses both images and sounds.During the pandemic, I began to perceive things in our everyday life very differently. The pandemic has caused us all to attach different positive and negative connotations to so many different experiences and things.
